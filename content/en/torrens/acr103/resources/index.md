## Software

You'll need a few software packages on your pc, whether it's your home pc for assesments or a laptop you're bringing to class.

### Maya 2020

Autodesk provides their industry standard 3D software to students. Sign up, download _Maya_ and use the serial number they provide.

### Photoshop or Krita

You'll also need to be able to create/edit images 

Photoshop is preferred and will be demonstrated in class. Krita is a quality, free alternative.

### Pureref

Opening your reference and concepts in Pureref throughout a project is key to good finished work.

You can choose **installer or portable** from the dropdowns on the download page. A portable version just unzips to a folder.
