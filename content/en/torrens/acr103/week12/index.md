## Texturing process

Topics covered in the [dmcgits week 11 notes](https://dmcgits.github.io/mds/ACR103/week11_notes.html)
1. Excellent video tutorials
2. Start big, work toward details. It's the same principle as blocking in.
3. Think in terms of light and shadow
   - Remember, all the lighting is in your texture, no lights will be used to render it.
4. Use reference chosen specifically for the lighting! This is where your style reference comes in.
5. Coloured light, coloured shadow. Light isn't often white and shadows are rarely black.
6. Critical lesson about simplifying shadow shapes, light shapes: 10 minutes to better painting.
7. Case study: Team Fortress 2
8. Keep moving, control edges!
