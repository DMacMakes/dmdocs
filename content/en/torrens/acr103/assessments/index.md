## Assessment 1: Low Poly Prop

> READ THE DELIVERABLES CAREFULLY: Every trimester students lose easy marks by skimming the deliverable details. Use the right settings, note the number of images and types of files to submit!

Your task is to model a high quality, low-polygon-count model from one of the concepts provided below:

Click for high resolution verison.

### Due Dates:
**Week 3 Deliverables** 
* Blockout and answers due in discussion forums by **11:55pm Monday Jun 20**

**Final Submission: Week 4 Deliverables**  
Final images and Maya project **11:55pm Sunday Jun 26, end of Week 4.**

### Week 3 submission details

You need to have **blocked out your model** in sufficient detail to communicate the concept well through the silhouette:no fine detail yet, but it should communicate the object type, its proportions, and whether it's dynamic or very rigid, hand or machine made, realistic or cartoony, focussed on charm or accuracy.

1. Capture **3-4 images** of your blocked out model. 
    * Screenshot them from the Maya viewport. They can be JPG or PNG
    * Choose a few angles/views that show the qualities of the model well. A 3/4 shot looking down on the model (like in the concepts) is always a good idea.
    * Enable _wireframe on shaded_ and _ambient occlusion_ in the viewport.
    * Don't submit tiny images, zoom in so your model takes up a lot of screenspace.  

2. **By Monday, 11:55pm, reply to** [this post on the discussion forums](https://torrens.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_126392_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_292171_1&forum_id=_1178191_1&message_id=_3189463_1). 
    * Insert your **screenshots** into the post (not as attachments, as embedded images so we can see them)
    * Paste in a screenshot of **pureref** showing any 3D style reference you looked up.
    * In your reply, **answer these questions**. _Think about your answers carefully: half-efforts or copied answers will hurt your marks._  
      1. Describe the elements of style that you saw in the model, and sought to capture in 3D (100 words).  
      2. What were your main challenges in and blocking your chosen prop? What characteristics did you think you captured, and was there anything you weren't satisfied with? (100 words)  

### Week 4 submission details

#### Deliver:
1. Create a folder for your final deliverables. Call it `Firstname_Lastname_A1_ACR103`, substituting your own name.
2. Copy into the folder:
    * Your **final maya scene file**. In your scenes folder, find your latest `.ma` or `.mb` file.
    * The **renders and screenshots** described below
3. Zip up the folder and submit the `Firstname_Lastname_A1_ACR103.zip` file to the [assessment 1 page on blackboard](https://torrens.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_10554663_1&course_id=_126392_1)
