### Welcome

1. Who's here? 
2. Who plays games?
3. Who's thought about making games for a living or a hobby?
4. Hands up if you thought of doing it as a programmer?
5. As an artist?
6. Let's google a few games you know, have a look at the art.
7. Who knows what a character or a tank or a tree in a game is made of?

**Things we see in our 3d games, what are they?**

### Splatoon 2 shoe Substance

**In substance**, as we add more information with textures:  

1. White blob with wireframe
2. Add colour, looks like printed balloom
3. Add normal map, light is affecting it as if it had way more triangles. But now it looks like a bumpy baloon because it's all glossy
4. Add roughness, now we're talking. Fabric areas are less shiney than the leather/vinyl and the plastic.
5. Add emissive for glow
6. Add post effects to pop the glow and exposure,  give a bit of camera lens distortion
