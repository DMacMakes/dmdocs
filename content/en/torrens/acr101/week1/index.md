## Due This Week:

### Daily Doodle - Journal And Forums
Draw every day this week! Draw from life or your head, but make sure it's at least 20 minutes, uninterrupted.

1. Create a **post in your Journal** (linked from assessment 3 on [Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/)) for "Week 1 Daily Doodles", edit that post each day to add a new doodle.
2. Create a **thread** called "Bob's Week 1 Doodles" (use your own name) in the [Module 1 forums](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/forum?action=list_threads&forum_id=_805302_1&conf_id=_133410_1&course_id=_83802_1&nav=discussion_board_entry) and post your doodles there too.

### Splash Screen - Journal

The splash screen is a Journal activity for **Assessment 3**. As above, your Journal is on [Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/) under Assessment 3 for this subject.

1. Go to <https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games> 
2. Select two games from the list and give them a cursory play.
3. Analyse their aesthetic:
    - What style are they using? Comic? Realism? Minimalism?
      - NB: ‘Pixel’ is not a valid answer. In the 90’s, this was high fidelity gaming!
    - What kinds of palettes are they using? Limited? Complementary?
    - Does the art direction fit the game’s direction?
    - Do you think the aesthetic works for the game?
    - What are some common motifs or elements?
4. **Write a couple of paragraphs** about each game and post on your **Journal**. 
   -"Week 1 Splash Screen" would be fine as a title.
   - Accompany the post **with a screenshot/example** of the aesthetic of each game. 
5. Pick **one** of the two games you selected for your analysis.
6. **Create** a re-imagined, refreshed **splash image** for the game in your art software of choice (_Photoshop_, _Krita_ etc.)
    - This is a challenge! Don’t simply redraw the original splash art – use inspiration, palettes and elements from the original to inspire a 2010’s ‘reboot’.
    - When done, **post** to your Journal.
    - _**PNG**_ or a high quality _**JPG**_ (jpg quality setting not below 8/10 ). Resolution can reflect the original game's, or use an HD res: `1280x720`, or `1920x1080` are handy.
