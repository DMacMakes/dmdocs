## Class Notes

Weekly notes are accessible from the **left navigation bar** on PC or the <i class="fas fa-bars"></i> **menu button** on mobile. 

{{% alert title="Important:" color="primary" %}}
We'll work from the notes in class each week, so **open them when you arrive**. They also link contain weekly **exercises** to complete between classes. 
{{% /alert %}}

## Join Discord

[I have my own Discord](https://discord.gg/nC7b5tN) because it'll take everyone a while to get the hang of Blackboard. You'll have lots of questions and need lots of links, and as gamers we're more likely to notice Discord than emails about blackboard.
