Rough summary: It's a journal you will share only with me, and it contains images you made for the weekly exercises, along with your reflections on how you used/benefited from class theory in their creation. By the end of the Trimester you'll have at least 12 entries.

**Due:** 11:55PM, Sunday at end of Week 12 (module 6.2). 
**Weighting:** 30%.

### Weekly Deliverables

## Assessment 1: Character Portfolio

**Due Date:** 11:55pm, Wednesday, **April 1**. (revised due to campus closure)

First, read the brief carefully:

[Brief on Blackboard](https://learn-ap-southeast-2-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5c07149a959f5/15620432?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ACR101%2520Assessment%25201.2019113.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200317T031337Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIW5OVFIUOTV36DNA%2F20200317%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=c5aaccaf0afc2a3bd67edab1aae8b46fd04f124aef5e70a995bd6001318eb738)

### Deliverables

12 pages, as per the brief, with 5 or so for being reference.

Handy specs:
* Jpg (90% quality) or png
* Largest dimension around 2500-3000px (width for landscape, height for portrait).
* Named 1_content_of_page.jpg, 2_content_of_page.jpg and so on.
  * eg: 1_backstory_and_poses.jpg, 2_first_sketches_and_reference.jpg
* A little text to explain what you're showing.
* Credit any artist's work below/on each image. (no need to credit random photographs of swords etc)

Zip all 12 (or more) page files into one archive and submit it via Blackboard. Name it as follows:

`firstName_lastName_character_folio_acr101.zip`.

#### Templates

Here are some PSD files you can use as page templates. 

1. [Landscape, 4K PSD](character_folio_template_landscape.psd)
2. [Portrait, almost 4K PSD](character_folio_template_portrait.psd).

Each is just a blank white page with enough resolution to support your images. If you use these templates **you can export a JPG or PNG at 75% scale** for your final submission and have enough resolution.

Because some people were unsure about visualising the whole 12 pages and laying it out, there's layer in the psds with **12 grey thumbnail pages** matching the ratio of the template. Might come in handy for planning.

### Filling 12 Pages

Some ideas:
* silhouettes of various design ideas
* more silhouettes exploring your pick of those early ones
* drawings of character from silhouettes, exploring colour palettes
* Realistic vs styled
* character posed in common scenarios theyâ€™d likely be in (wolverine yelling at kids, pikachu shorting out his switch)
* turnaround
* show the exploration of faces/hairstyles/outfits along the way

## Assessment 2: Environment Portfolio

Similar to assessment 1 in idea and format, applied to environments.

[Brief page on Blackboard](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_8570135_1&course_id=_83802_1) (Tri 1, 2020)

{{< alert title="Environment" color= "primary" >}}
The game world. The landscape including trees, rivers, trails, roads, buildings, walls, citadels and so on. 

A game environment differs from a real world environment in that it often has to communicate things like goals, special areas, factions and the path to travel, all in clear and cinematic ways.
{{< /alert >}}

### Assessment Outline

* Research and create an environmental design portfolio. Imagine it will be used by artists to make the level assets for a real video game.
* It will be based on a single level/zone of a single game.
* This is not limited to 2D games, the concepts can be for any game and digital production.
* Designs can be a combination of a digitally painted concept, illustrations, texture studies and asset designs.
* Designs are part of a development portfolio with a minimum of 16 pages including final 2D render. 
* In class-exercises, sketches, mood boards and other research elements can contribute to the portfolio.
* Your facilitator will provide any additional information informing the brief, such as style, object or thematic guides.

### Submission/Deliverables

**Due Date:** Sunday May 10, 11:55pm.

* Environment Portfolio
    * High resolution images, not thumbnails. A landscape-orientation page should be around 2500px wide.
    * Minimum of **16 pages**
    * 5 pages minimum of references (can be spread throughout)
    * 1 page final environment Design Sheet
        * A3 Single sheet containing final renders.
        * Must include at least 1 coloured environment render.

Zip up or PDF your 16 pages.
* **Do not** use pdf if you aren't sure how to **preserve resolution** and quality.

### Filling 12 Pages

The numbering of the list isn't page counts, just a reference.

1. Level Idea 
   - written
   - game genre, gameplay
   - scenario for this level (eg raid on temple)
1. Photo Reference
2. Style Reference
    - On a team you'll probably be given a style to follow by the lead artist
    - We don't have that, so provide images of a style you would make the game in
    - Provide enough variety in image subjects to cover the style meaningfully: buildings, landscapes, props, foliage etc
    - Can use style of an existing game, or two games (it will be between this and this), or an artist you like online that produces art that could feasibly be in-game.
3. Maps
    - Sketching out a top down map (maybe rpg or rts game) or side on map (platformer, brawler) is great planning step. 
    - Getting player from a to b in your mind, over a rough map, tells you things you'll need ie. rubble pile, collapsed temple, tree with branches to jump on etc
4. Scenes
     - Wide angle shot of a whole scene not from a gameplay perspective perhaps: more something to evoke the experience of the place, like a holiday photograph.
5. Various buildings
6. Key (and less key) props/set pieces
    - ramshackle old ladders, barricades, gutters to shimmy
    - blown up truck, raised garden beds
    - elevator apparently formed of vines
7. Vegetation
    - Tropical, alpine? Tree 1, tree 2, shrub, grass (very high, high, medium, low)
8. Features supporting game mechanics (barricades, climb-ables, stuff to shimmy, destructables)
9. Areas for encounters:
    - boss fight area: is she on a giant spinning platform? Are there lava pits?

## What Have I/You Forgotten?

There's a fair bit to remember when it comes to submitting your work. Here's a list of things to look for, and to ask me about if I've left them out.
  * Final due dates and smaller deliverable due dates
  * Tasks - what are we making?
  * Deliverables - what outputs are needed, in what structure?
  * Specific file formats and requirements:
    * PSD with layers or flat PNG? What version of the program do I export from? 
    * How do I deliver large files? How do I reduce file size?
  * Etc
