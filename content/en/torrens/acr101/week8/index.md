We've had 7 heavy weeks of work and not a small amount of drama with the change in lifestyle for all of us. This week is going to be a bit lighter, but the concepts are so vital and engaging that hopefully you'll be inspired to play a lot with these concepts at home.

### Exercise

You've learned about seeing large shapes in dynamic paintings. Now look at your own painting and see where you can simplify areas and make them more dynamic by cleaning up/altering/creating shapes in there. 

## Homework

Give yourself 30 minutes to paint the major values in the image below by Catell Ruiz. Post it to the discussion forum in the [Week 8 - Environment practise](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_83802_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_133410_1&forum_id=_805305_1&message_id=_2024923_1) thread at least one day before class (by Monday night if class is Tuesday).

* You can use 5 major values
* Look for good shapes
* Don't paint most of the lines (edges between slats, drop shadow on every tile)
* Steer clear of blending except on the one or two rounded roof/beam bits it's needed. 
* Keep moving around the image, don't stay long in one place
* You don't always have to brush/paint. Try selecting an area with the freehand lasso tool and filling it ðŸ‘Œ
