## Last Week:

[Due in Week 6](../week6/#due-this-week)

## Discussing Assessment 1

* Due this week!
* Checking in on progress
* Answering questions.
* Adding in this week's activities

## Aliased Painting

To explore colours you need to be able to quickly alter them as a group and individually. If you have gradients or soft edges, that gets hard and you end up wasting time with bad seams and other messes.

* Painting with hard edges stops shapes from blurring into one another. 
* Then you can **easily change colours** with wand select, adjust hue/sat and bucket fill.

For tools like marquee select and lasso select
* disable anti aliasing

For tools like bucket fill and wand select:
* disable anti aliasing
* set tolerance to 0
* disable "contiguous" if you want to select areas of a colour that aren't connected

For drawing **use the _Pencil_ tool**, which is like the _Brush_ but it always has a hard, jaggy edge. For its shape, righ click the canvas and select _Hard Round_ or _Hard Round Pressure Size_ (under general brushes).
