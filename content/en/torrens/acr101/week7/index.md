## Assessment 1 is Overdue, Act Now!
See Teams/MyLearn announcements.

## Drawing Tips and Warmup Exercise
We'll be creating environments/buildings for assessment 2, so let's practise drawing shapes and lines with confidence.

Marco Bucci! **Let's watch this video together** on Teams.

Give yourself 30 minutes to paint the major values in the image below by Catell Ruiz. Post a screenshot of your finished work in the channel/forum provided by your lecturer.

* You can trace the building silhouette if you like, to focus the exercise on shadows. Do the internal shapes and shading by hand.
* You can use 5 major values
* Look for good shapes
* Don't paint most of the lines (edges between slats, drop shadow on every tile)
* Steer clear of blending except on the one or two rounded roof/beam bits it's needed. 
* Keep moving around the image, don't stay long in one place
* You don't always have to brush/paint. Try selecting an area with the freehand lasso tool and filling it ðŸ‘Œ

## Assessment 2: Environment Portfolio

Check out the dmdocs ACR101 [assessment page](../assessments/#assessment-2-environment-portfolio)

* 16 pages, as with character folio.
* Incorporates work done in class and updated journal.
* Minimum (equivalent) 5 pages of reference.
  
## Good Shapes

Marco Bucci again! **Watch this video** on your own pc. When you're done, come back to the stream and **type '{)'** in chat.

## Exercise

You've learned about seeing large shapes in dynamic paintings. Now look at your own painting and see where you can simplify areas and make them more dynamic by cleaning up/altering/creating shapes in there. 

## Homework/Journal Task

Apply what your learned today by drawing and shading one of these faces. Again, you can trace the silhouette as a starting point.
