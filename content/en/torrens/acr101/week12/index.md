{{< alert title="Work From Photo Reference" color= "warning" >}}
Remember, other people's art, other designs, those are great for _style_ reference, as in how to handle edges and forms and light. 

For your actual subject matter, the landscapes, buildings, details and props, **look to photo reference.** Other people's art is not only their intellectual property, it's filtered and interpreted. They've taken out so many things that there's less to work from, less inspiration, less chance to have your own ideas come through.

## Q&A

We all have **pain points** in our art process, analog or digital, that slow us down, bum us out.
