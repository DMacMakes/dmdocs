## Making Environment Concept Art

* Last week we looked at painting objects with a few _values (brightness)_
* Environment art also includes whole scenes, evoking the feel of a level/world.
* How do get from objects to painting whole scenes?

## Reviewing The Homework

* Great effort, everyone did well
* There's an ambiguity when strong colours are involved: The red/orange roof appears darker than the beige wood. Do we paint the value of the light, or the colour?

Week 8 - environment practise on the discussion forum

Handy ideas for next time:
1. Work in passes
    * Paint just the light in one pass, ignoring the colours (it takes practise to be able to see them separately)
    * Paint in the differing levels in the paint (the red is a darker value colour than the beige)
2. Squint away the colour!
    * You would have noticed squinting washes away the details and helps you see big value shapes
    * Our ability to see colour also drops quickly with less light
    * So: squinting will reduce the colour contrast too
3. Imagine you'll be dropping the colours in under the light later

### Putting Colour Under/Over Values

Painting Under:
1. Make a layer below your values layer called _"colour flats"_
2. Name your _values_ layer _"light values"_
3. Change your _light values_ layer blend mode to _overlay_

Painting Over:
1. Make a layer above your values layer called _"colour flats"_
2. Name your _values_ layer _"light values"_
3. Change your _colour flats_ layer blend mode to _colour_

Both:
4. Choose the freehand lasso tool and turn off anti aliasing
5. Draw out the whole house shape, fill with beige. (alt-backspace, or bucket fill no anti aliasing)
6. Select the red/orange roof areas, fill with with colour
7. Repeat for grey metal, bricks, purple shingles, greyish path, ground

## Homework

* Pick one of the thumbnail ideas you didn’t use today, or make up your own.
* Make 2-3 400px thumbnails and pick the one you like best. 
* Paint up your scene at a higher resolution using what you already know (paintbrush work) plus the steps we learned today where they help.
    - Deliver an image 1000px wide
    - I recommend working at 2000px wide and then exporting it scaled down 50% (bicubic automatic) as a png. In Photoshop you can use File > Export > Export As…
* Post to discussion forum in [module 5 -  Week 9 – Homework thread](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_83802_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_133410_1&forum_id=_805306_1&message_id=_2036350_1)
