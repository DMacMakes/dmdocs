{{< imgcard wowser_turn Link "wowser_turn.png">}}
This guy.
{{< /imgcard >}}

## The brief

* Little learning things. 
* Mischevious, initially pretty dim. 
* Maybe like _Minions?_
* Level up as they learn
* Can be dressed up for any era and as any historical figure
* Can manipulate tools.

For anyone who looks at a character and goes "Urrrr, these guys are so lazy. Just copy Pikachu and take the day off"... **strap in!**

## Choices

### Develop This Guy
My art director and first tier clients wanted a guy we called earhands guy, I did variations on that. Went through colours, bigger toothier face etc.

{{< imgcard earhands_swarm Link "earhands_swarm.jpg">}}
Many ears
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< imgcard earhands_choose Link "earhands_choose.jpg">}}
Earhands choose??
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< imgcard earhands_choose_chub Link "earhands_choose_chub.jpg">}}
Earhands choose chubby?
{{< /imgcard >}}

Art director passed on to clients. Clients unsure, wanted to see cuter.

{{< imgcard earguy_cuter_peach Link "earguy_cuter_peach.png">}}
Cuter, turnaround, more clarity around limbs including slick footwear.
{{< /imgcard >}}

### Modify And Test

Also how he'd look teaching

{{< imgcard earguy_teaching Link "earguy_teaching.png">}}
The character levelled up through learning, so how does he look teaching/learning?
{{< /imgcard >}}

### Recutify

More rounder, egg/minion like, softer

{{< imgcard earhands_more_cuter Link "earhands_more_cuter.png">}}
Earhands more cuter: rounder, more like a minion, more eggy, softer.
{{< /imgcard >}}

## Hang On

If I recall correctly, this is when the client's client had reservations and wanted to bring back a few other options. That might sound like an eye rolling moment, but not if you liked your options and enjoy designing characters! 

Client was unsure and requested a survey image they could show to a small focus group of regular people

{{< imgcard survey_sheet Link "survey_sheet.png">}}
Survey sheet.
{{< /imgcard >}}

People went for the pikachuish one. Could be appeal, could be recognition, could be biased by the dancing vs static poses, no way to know. 

{{< alert title="There Is No Why" color= "warning" >}}
If you try to know why a final, single choice was made, you'll never relax into the job. People don't fully know why they love things. What they do know generally, is a polished, **fundamentally solid** character design vs a janky one. I know **each of the variations had fans** in our office, all for their own reasons, I imagine the focus group was the same. Given the requirement to choose one, each chose, and that's that. 

Just **aim for valid, solid options**. You always have home hours to make/refine the stuff you personally prefer.

## Final Choice, Refine!

#### Turnaround 

Front view is 3D, others painted.

{{< imgcard wowser_turn Link "wowser_turn.png">}}
Wowser (aka yellow cat) turnaround.
{{< /imgcard >}}

#### Acting

How do they express? Can it be done without their face growing outside of a set texture area? Counter question: can we use a shader to emote with colour?

{{< imgcard wowsers_facial Link "wowsers_facial.png">}}
The express with sticker faces, colour gradients, ball changes?
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< imgcard wowsers_acting Link "wowsers_acting.jpg">}}
They express with their whole bodies.
{{< /imgcard >}}

## So This Happened

At some point I was asked to mock up what would happen if we had a mobile fantasy rpg game with Wowsers in it. I can't recall why but if you let me do it I absolutely will.

{{< imgcard wowsers_rpg Link "wowsers_rpg.png">}}
Good times!
{{< /imgcard >}}

## Bonus: Siegecraft Commander

### How to explore options 

Get loose. Just give options. Here, for the Peon Commander I've mostly varied the hair, headband, bandanna, gloves, shirt.

{{< imgcard sc_peon_comm_accessories Link "sc_peon_comm_accessories.png">}}
{{< /imgcard >}}

To create a variety of faces, I started with yellow blobs to focus solely on varying the shape dramatically.
