## Controlling Execution

We know that **completing a task** is **stepping through a list** of instructions.  That list might be written on paper, spoken to someone, or typed into a computer.

We've stepped through these instructions in two ways so far: **sequentially** and **selectively**. Today we'll add the third, **repetitively**.

{{< alert title="Definition: Execute" color= "primary" >}}
To complete a task you first _complete_ each _step_.<br /><br />
In programming we often talk about _**stepping**_ through and _**executing**_ each _**line**_ of code.
{{< /alert >}}

#### 1. _**Sequential**_ Execution

We go through the statements in the _**sequence**_ or order they're presented: 1st, 2nd, 3rd until we reach the end. This is how a program works by default.

Knights Journey runs in a straight line.
{{< /imgproc >}}

####  2. _**Selective**_ Execution

AKA branching. You step through the instructions in a straight line until you come to a decision. Then you consider a condition and.. **_select_** which step to execute next,

* Is it equal to my favourite dessert?
* Does it weight more than I can lift?

{{< /imgproc >}}

#### 3. _**Repetitive**_ Execution

{{< youtube "F2A-0IF4sqI" >}}
<br />
Considered on its own, _**repetition**_ is a simple, endless, maybe boring process. When you introduce the **entering** and **exiting** of loops, things start happen.

## Games Are Loops (in loops (in loops))

In games we often start at a **menu**, then choose a **game mode**. We then play our actual game, often, in **rounds**, **halves/quarters** or **levels**.

{{< imgproc menu_main_guac Resize "600x">}}
<i>Guacamelee's</i> main menu, to which we ultimately return.

## Guessy Help: Coding A `while` Loop

Guessy Number involved blind guessing. Let's help players by telling them if their guess is too low or too high. But first...

{{< alert title="DIS-CODE QUIZ" color="primary" >}}
I need to know if the player's guess was too low, but the test on line 4 is missing! Type your answer in [ise102 on Discord](https://discord.gg/ZDyHS6N).

```cpp {linenos=inline,hl_lines=[4]}
secretNumber = 2
cin >> playerGuess;

if ( ??? ? ??? ) {   // player guess too low
  cout >> "Nope, you need to guess higher."
}
```
_(hint: variable, relational operator, variable)_
{{< /alert >}}

### Exercise: Code *guessy\_number\_help*

1. Create a new C++ *console* project in Visual Studio. Call it *guessy\_number\_help*.
2. Replace the code in `guessy_number_help.cpp` with the following:
3. Test it out.

{{< imgcard code_guessy_help_blanks Link "code_guessy_help_blanks.png">}}
Using <i>repetition</i> for multiple guesses and <i>selection</i> for hints.

### How `while` Works
One way to repeat in _C++_ (and many languages) is with the `while` loop.  For any loop to be useful, we need to be able to **enter** it, **repeat** it, and **exit** it.

`while` supports all of these with the one test, but you have to **help**:
1. You **enter** the loop by **passing the test** in parentheses `()`, like an `if`.
2. You **repeat** the loop by **continuing to pass** the test.
3. You **exit** the loop by **failing to pass** the test. 


Here's the **syntax**
```cpp {linenos=inline}
while ( test )
{
  // Lines of code to execute.
}
```

{{< alert title="Critical: Different Outcomes Require Different Values" color="danger" >}}
To repeat the loop you must past the test continually, but unless you find a way to fail it will **loop infinitely**.

To fail the test, the **variables you're testing must change value!**

```cpp {linenos=inline}
while (secretNumber != playerGuess) {
  // The loop is running because these two numbers are different.
  // For the loop to end, secretNumber or playerGuess has to change value!
}
```
{{< /alert >}} 

### Exiting with `break;`

You can stop execution of a loop using the `break` keyword.

```cpp {linenos=inline}
while (secretNumber != playerGuess) {
  // some code
  if ( some test )
  {
    break;        // Loop will stop executing...
  }
  // some code
}
// ...program will jump here and resume 
```

### Continue Loops In The Textbook

[Chapter 2](../resources/cpp_through_games_2.pdf) and [Chapter 3](../resources/cpp_through_games_3.pdf) cover other useful loop structures you'll need, including `do... while` and `for` loops.

## Smarter Decisions With _Logical Operators_

Right now we have a very simple test to end our game: `playerGuess == secretNumber`.  To make our game more interesting, we decide to limit the player to 3 guesses.

### Exercise 2: Enter guessy_number_limit

{{< imgcard code_guessy_limit_blanks Link "code_guessy_limit_blanks.png">}}
Limiting the players to 3 games sets a new standard in high stakes gaming. 
{{< /imgcard >}}

### Setting Multiple Conditions

For some tests we need to meet **more than one condition**.

"We can play basketball _on the weekend_ if _it's not raining_"
  - Is it the weekend AND is it not raining?

"If the _dough is free of lumps_ and the _oven has preheated to 200C_ bake the dough for 25 minutes"
  - Is the dough lump free AND the oven temperature 200C?

In these examples test A **AND** test B both need to be true.

#### Testing With `&&` In Guessy Limit

You want to guess the number in Guessy Limit: What two things need to be true?  **Don't think about the code!** Think of it like you're the game master, and a child is the guesser:

"Can I guess?"
"Let me see: _if_ you haven't guessed the secret number _AND_ _if_ you haven't had 3 guesses... sure!"

### More Logical Operators

Logical operators are similar to using **and**, **or** and **not** in a sentence. **Or** works with two variables or values like **and** does. 

| Word    |   C++ Symbol    | When to use   |
|----|----|----|
| And     | &&              | I need **both** tests to evaluate to `true` |
| Or      | \|\|              | I need **at least one** test to evaluate to `true` | 
| Not     | !   | I need the following thing **not** to evaluate as true. |

<br />
**Not** works a little differently. It still fits in this category because you might say _"I need a **and not** b to be `true`"_. 

```cpp
//// If our game had a quit feature:
if ( guessesRemaining > 0 && !playerHasQuit )
{
  // This code runs if they haven't used all their guesses and they haven't quit.
  // (playerHasQuit here is a bool, true or false)
}
```

### Continue In The Textbook

As you read the textbook this week for homework, you'll encounter logical operators from **page 58** onward. Read it carefully and, if you aren't sure of anything, try some tests in code!

## Summary

This week we:
* learned how to **enter, repeat and exit loops**. 
* discovered ways to decide **whether to continue** a loop at the top, middle or bottom.
  - `while` evaluates at the top
  - `do... while` evaluates at the bottom
  - `break;` can exit from anywhere.
* learned to use **multiple conditions** with logical operators
  - `&&`, `||` and `!`

## Homework
Below there is reading and 2 coding exercises.

### Submission
**Email me** the cpp files for `guessy_number_limit` and `play_again_2` by the **end of saturday**.

### To do
1. Complete [Exercise 2 Guessy number limit](#exercise-2-enter-guessy_number_limit)
2. Read the rest of [Chapter 2](../resources/cpp_through_games_2.pdf) of the textbook, where you'll learn about other types of loops. You're beginning from **page 48**. 
3. In a new C++ *console* project called `play_again_2`, **type and run** _Play Again 2.0_ on **page 54**. Now, **change the game** to use a menu with 2 entries (shown below) and look for `1` or `2` as their input.

```
  **You just played an exciting game**
  
  Do you want to play again?
  1. Play again
  2. Quit
  Enter 1 or 2 > _
```
{{< alert title="Homework tips/details" color= "primary" >}}
  - Remember to change `char` to `int`
  - `1` continues (loops to show message and menu again), `2` exits the game. 
  - Note the cursor (where they enter input) should sit where I've placed a fake one.. just after "Enter 1 or 2 > ", not on a new line. Remember, `cin` causes that cursor to appear.
  - If they input some other number, print "!! Hey, only enter 1 or 2 !!" and loop.
