## Week 6 Homework Review

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="../week6/#homework" target="_blank">Week 6 Homework<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

1. Move code to functions
2. Pseudocode two other functions
   - Display credits screen
   - Display menu get choice
* How did I do week 6's homework?
* Why did I do it that way?

## Exercise 1

Work along with me as I write out my solution to the homework:
* If you didn't finish it
* If you did it but have fixes

I will start from blanked out code you had to type out to get started. If you haven't typed that, start doing it and keeping up as best you can. You'll have a little time to catch it up before exercise 2.

-->

## Code from the review

Written during yesterday's review, it's the base we're moving forward on (or an equally functional base you wrote for homework).

If you haven't watched the review and don't have this code ready, stop watching now and do that first. Watch the rest of this class recording afterwards

## Simultaneous activities:

While people are catching up on that code, I'll go over the trickier pickles in week 4's exam with those who are up to date.

{{< alert title="Code catch up" color= "secondary" >}}
If you didn't follow along with me or still have some to finish, type in the code below/add fixes to your homework. 

If your code is similar enough to mine as makes no difference (just different variable names maybe?), skip this step.

## Exercise 1: Refreshing the console

Our game is scrolling off down the screen like a chatroom. It's not a natural fit for our game, with its distinct screens.

Run the windows command prompt by pressing <kbd>win</kbd> and typing `cmd`, then press <kdb>enter</kbd>. When the command prompt/console window appears:
1. Type `dir`&#8629; 
2. Type `cls`&#8629; to clear the directory listing from the screen.

![cls in the console](cls_console.png)
Here's what happens if you type <i>cls &#8629;</i>  in a regular windows command prompt. Don't worry, in c++ we won't see the `c:\Users\username` prompt.


### Clearing in C++

C++ doesn't know a lot about the console, and doesn't have its own way to clear it. That's considered Window's own problem. We can get around it by running "cls" from inside C++ using `system()` like so:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>   // Access the `system` command in the cstdlib header.
...

cout << "Line 1" << endl;
system("cls");
cout << "Line 2" << endl;
```

Why does that work?

{{< alert title="cls: Clear Screen" color= "secondary" >}}
`system("cls");` wipes the console clear and puts the cursor top left, because that's what `cls` would have done in the console. 

We're using the special `system()` function in *C++*, it can run an external command if it it's available wherever our program runs. With a console program we could use `system` to run more than just `cls` - `dir` or `echo hello` for example.

{{< /alert >}}

## Add screen clear to Slots

Adding `system("cls")` between screens.

`main()`, the boss, controls what's showing next on screen by calling functions. 
- functions don't know what happens before or after they're done. They just output stuff and pause.
- This makes it `main()`'s job to trigger the clear.

**Demo** adding clear.


### A bug appears

> Our game returns to the main menu at random points? Why?

We have theories, and some of you know this answer right away. That might come from a bit of coding experience, or reading ahead, or just seeing the problem.

**We can't always rely on intuiting the problem.** We need a way to see what's happening, to slow things down or stop them, to see inside our program as it runs on our cpu.

## Making the computer wait

We need to **wait for people to read before clearing the screen**. We could wait for:

{{< alert title="Time" color= "secondary" >}}

Waiting for x seconds might work.
  * When a screen is done, we tell the program to wait or sleep for the right amount of time.. but do we know it?
  * what about slow readers? 
  * Or fast readers?
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Input" color= "primary" >}}
Let the user decide.
  * RPGs have lots of text to read, and they let you tap a button to move on. That's a better fit.
  * How do we ask the computer to wait for a single key to be pressed?
  * Where do we put the code?
{{< /alert >}}

### Wait for key press: _getch()
`_getch` is a function available in `<conio.h>` that pauses the program until a key is pressed. It stands for _get character_ and returns a code for the key/character.

If your program only needs to wait for any key press there's no need to save the return value. The waiting is useful in itself.

### Who's in charge of pausing? 

There are a few places `_getch()` could go now and get us the right result.. for the moment.

If you don't think about which functions should do the job, you can come unstuck later.

**Does main need to know** which screens need key press pausing and which don't? 
  * What if some already have a natural pause at the end?
  * What if some _do_ work better with timer, like maybe the exit screen?
**Do the functions know** when they've displayed something that needs to be seen before returning to main?
  * Yes, they do.

Let's put them at the end of the functions, where our breakpoints went.

## Fleshing out pseudocoded functions

Display menu loop.

Pseudocode more detailed PlaySlots.

## The menu loop

I want the menu to **handle bad input gracefully**. This isn't just because it's good practice: **in the brief, 15%** of the marks go toward user testing and data validity checks:

![](brief_data_validity.png)

So we'll catch mistakes and prompt the user to try again. At a minimum, if they enter a number that isn't a menu choice, should be caught and an error message shown.

![](menu_input_check.png)

First, here's a simple bullet list breakdown.

* Display cash total (argument)
* Display choices
* Ask for a choice
* Check if their choice is valid (in the range of choices)
* Show them an appropriate error and make them choose again until they succeed.
* return choice

### Planning

Note, firstly, I've changed the name from displayMenuGetChoice. It's consistent with other functions now. The function signature and intellisense (little popup on hover) tell us the return value.

The main problem to solve is checking input and showing errors to the player. 
  * Multiple attempts (and showing errors) requires a loop
  * Screen isn't scrolling so redraw the whole menu to show errors. Whole menu is inside the loop then.  
  * Since we clear and redraw screen to show error, we'll need to remember the error. (Can't just write it to screen as soon as it's discovered)

## TODO :rework with last week's in-line pseudocode
Write it based on the code i ended up writing in class, but throw in a bug or two to show how to work through them?
Add homework!
## Pseudocode 

{{< alert title="First pass" color= "primary" >}}
Thinking about the problem in a high level way, but with coding structure (A halfway point between bullet list and pseudocode).

```
start DISPLAY_MENU_SCREEN ( with playerCash )
  Things to store:
    A valid range of menu choices.
    Their choice
    A way to remember if the choice was in range so we don't repeat the checking code.
    A relevant error message we can print.

  Processing to do:
  loop while validChoice isn't true
    Show the player's cash
    Tell user the menu options and number them
    Show an error if one was previously made
    Get their choice
    If their choice is in range, set validChoice to true
    else set an error message for next loop.
  end while
    
```
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Second pass" color= "secondary" >}}
Time to plan the structure properly, with variable names (storage), output, conditionals (processing) and input.

```
start DISPLAY_MENU_SCREEN ( playerCash )
  error = ""
  validChoice = false
  choice = 0;
  
  while not validChoice
    
    print "You have " $playerCash
    print menu choices
    print error (if it's not empty/blank)
    print "Enter 1 2 or 3 >"
    
    choice = player input
    if choice isnt in range
      error = "Nope, just press a number and hit enter."
    else
      validChoice = true
    end if
  end while
    
end DISPLAY_MENU_SCREEN
```

## Killing bugs with the _Debugger_

The debugger is a few things: 

It's a **special interface mode** of Visual Studio that
* Lets you stop and start program exection
* Shows you the contents of variables without having to use `cout`

{{< imgcard debugger_outcomes Link "debugger_outcomes.png">}}
No cout required: the <i>debugger</i> halting and looking inside the program in real time
{{< /imgcard >}}

In the background it's also a program that is running and seeing into our program's memory, like Neo in the Matrix.
   * It has special permission to **access and change** your program's data and instructions **in memory**
   * It relies partly on code that visual studio compiles into your program

{{< imgproc see_code_agents Resize "700x">}}
Hello, Mr Smith.
{{< /imgproc >}}

### Breakpoints

The first way we'll use it by **setting breakpoints**: points at which to take a break.
  * Set a breakpoint in the credits screen function, just before it returns.
  * Set a breakpoint in the play slots screen too.

{{< imgcard debug_breakpoint_controls >}}
Execution controls and the breakpoint marker
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< alert title="The takeaway" color= "primary" >}}
our program didn't start randomly going back to the menu screen. It was always displaying main after drawing screens, it just hadn't been wiping everything else away when it did. 
{{< /alert >}}

## Squashing other bugs

There are enough variations on mistakes that the bugs we can create are effectively infinite.
Infinity is too many items to check, we need a smaller list. We need to use the power of **ABSTRACTION!**

### Categorising bugs

We need some categories (a form of abstraction) that almost all our bugs will fit in. Here are 3 

Design bugs:
Your way of solving the problem has logic issues.
* The math doesn't actually solve the problem 
  * eg: your formula for cylinder surface area actually gives cone surface area
* Your test isn't testing what you think it's testing:
  * Your logic is testing a smaller or larger range than you realise
  * The order in which you test things misses certain cases

#### Implementation bugs:

A) Random mistakes (attention, coordination, lack of sleep)
* Typing errors
* Inconsistent upper/lower case

B) Translation fail
* Your design was solid. Your code doesn't actually do what the design does.
* Overlaps a lot with C)

C) C++ inexperience/knowledge shortfalls:
* Your structure doesn't send 
* We think an operator/keyword/function does one thing, in truth it does another.

#### 'External' bugs:
Things that either A) we didn't do, or B) that we did but not in the code or design.
A) things:
* Placing things in the wrong directory
* Not informing Visual Studio that we put something in a  directory
B) things:
* Bugs in Visual Studio
* Bugs in libraries we're using

## Looking for bugs

<!-- Looking for bugs follows the scientific process.
1. Observe a problem.
2. Theorise about the cause and solution.
3. Devise a test that, if you are right, produces result x.
   * A different input that proves the nature of the error?
   * Some new code that should fix it?
4. If x isn't produced, go back to 2.
5. If x is produced, check your code and see if 
-->
### Look at the output symptoms
This helps best when you have a rough idea of the problem and you're not too far wrong.

1) What is the output?
2) What output did you expect in this case?
3) What other outputs to you expect in other cases? Plan them and test them.
4) Add more outputs with `cout <<` or other methods. Called **debug outputs**.

### Step through with debugger
Watch it happen, find the unexpected. 
* This is great for problems you've completely misunderstood from the symptoms. 
* You'll often misunderstand the bugs from design errors and inexperience/knowledge shortfall 

1) You still have to have expectations at each point of the program as you watch it run.
2) When it does something totally unexpected, you have a new possible culprit!
3) Form a new theory about the bug and test it.

old more slots 

## More Slots

{{< imgcard slots_3_output_2 Link "slots_3_output_2.png">}}

{{< /imgcard >}}

The game now:
1. Has `spinwWheels()` function that (claims to) generate numbers and returns an `outcome`.
1. Takes real bets and checking they're valid.
1. Uses the player's `bet`
1. Uses `outcome` and `bet` to calculate `winnings` (in `playSlots` function)
1. Has an `enum` containing multipliers for each win type.
1. Waits for keypress after a game, then clears screen and returns to menu.

## Debugging: What's WRONG With This Code?

{{< imgcard see_code_agents>}}
Hello, Mr Smith.
{{< /imgcard >}}

We have total control over the **_writing_** of our code. We can plan it, craft it carefully, line by line. We can tidy things into neat little packages, functions that promise to take what we have and give us what we need. We **mentally step over it**, imagining a user typing in responses, and see that.. yes, this will work very well, if I haven't missed something.

**Then.. you compile and run it.** It transforms in to a mysterious, shadowy thing living deep in the silicon brain of your computer. It's now binary 1s and 0s, expressed as real electrons slamming through copper at half the speed of light. 

And **yes, you have missed something.**

### Now What?!

We do what anyone does to fix a machine or process: calmly slice it down into some basic, manageable categories, then check them.

### Sources Of Bugs

First up, **you** are the source of 99% of bugs. Very occasionaly there's something wrong with a library or documentation. 

### Syntax Errors

These are the ones that stop you compiling, and are mostly pretty easy to fix. 
* Visual Studio tells you the kind of error along with the line it's on
* If you don't know the error, you Google it and usually
  * it's in the cpp reference or
  * someone on stackoverflow (or other forum) has solved it before.

{{< alert title="Definition: Syntax Error" color= "primary" >}}
A Syntax Error is a problem in the structure of your code that confuses the compiler and prevents it compiling. It can often be a single character out of place missing. 
Examples:
* missing or extra semicolon `;`
* swapping upperCase and lowerCase `animalCrackers` becomes `Animalcrackers`
* a forgotten parenthesis `)` or curly brace `}`
* accidentally escaping quotes so a string continues forever `\"`
* many, many others
{{< /alert >}}

### Logic Errors

These are the ones where your **program compiles, but doesn't do what you expected**. Also known as _semantic_ errors.

To get to the bottom of these, "what was my mistake?" is the question to answer. As always, things get easier when we group things into categories. Once you get used to **the kinds of mistakes you can make**, finding bugs  is easier.

#### The Design Error

{{< alert title="Chef Gomez" color= "warning" >}}
Chef Gomez, a huge celebrity chef, produces a book of dessert recipes. She becomes a meme on Instagram when every one who tries to cook his chocolate cake turn out giant chocolate cookies.
The recipe, it turns out, is a perfectly good one. Chef Gomez, on the other hand, apparently took a knock to the head and is convinced a cake is a large crunchy treat. 

**The problem is the design, not the way it was encoded as a recipe.**

<img src="cookie_cake.jpg" />

{{< /alert >}}

So you've **designed a solution** and then written code that **successfully implements** it. The steps you described, however, **wouldn't actually complete the given task**.

* eg: A program to find the volume of a cylinder: it's perfectly implemented in code.. but you were on the wrong wikipedia page and used the formula for a cone.
* eg: The character jumps and falls through the floor: it's coded right, but the math you chose for checking when a character hits a platform is faulty because you aren't great at geometry.

#### The Language Usage Error

* Solution was good but code implementation doesnt actually match your planned solution
* Spring from misunderstanding language
* Eg: you write a test for three of a kind and it’s well designed in psuedocode: but you misunderstand how to join up the tests (chaining `==` instead of using a combination of `==` and `&&`). It triggers for 3 of a kind  but also pairs.
* EG: the maths are right but answer us wrong. Maybe You aren’t accounting for the precision of floating points. Or you are adding integers and the result is larger than the variable can hold.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;
  int c = 0;

  if ( a == b == c )
  {
    cout << "\t Equal! \n";
  }
  else
  {
    cout << "\t Not equal :( \n";
  }
}
```
#### The Library Usage Error
* Passing the wrong scale of value in (milliseconds instead of seconds)
* Thinking a return value implies success, when it actually means error.

#### The Brain Fart

Don't foget the good old brain fart. They can be any of the above errors that happen despite your knowledge and experience because you're tired, distracted, hurrying etc. Especially common when you've been coding too long without a break, or don't eat and sleep enough.

* Assigning to the wrong variable
* Calling a function and forgetting to assign the result
* Switching your true/false logic
* Understanding operators but still just typing the wrong one (`>` instead of `>=` etc)
* Putting a return inside a loop instead of after it.

#### Others

Thoughts?

## Debugging By Output

### User Testing

Imagine you're the end user of a product. You can't change the code in any way. You can only test by:

1: Trying different inputs
2: Observing the output. 

In some cases, if you test enough inputs and notice a pattern in the outputs, you might just figure out what's happening.

### Adding Debug Output

Relying on the program's existing outputs is quite limiting, and we have to infer what's happening. We have a degree of freedom the user doesn't have.. we can make the computer output what it knows at any point. 

{{< imgproc talk_pulp_fiction Resize "600x">}}
Encourage your program to tell you things.
{{< /imgproc >}}

This is called `debug output`, and like a 1g1un in Samuel L Jackson's hand, it makes the program more _verbose_.


#### Example

Say we were calling `spinWheels()` in our slot machine to 1. generate 3 numbers and 2. check for a win. If the winnings were wrong for a given bet we might need to see variable values at certain times. We can do that with lots of cout statements. The word "DEBUG:" is just for readability.

{{< imgcard debug_output_bet_outcomes Link "debug_output_bet_outcomes.png">}}
Couts inserted: Click to zoom.
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< imgcard debug_outcomes_running Link "debug_outcomes_running.png">}}
Debug output while testing the game: Click to zoom
{{< /imgcard >}}



pros: 
* you can make lots of new information available: 
  * the state of your variables
  * the count reached by your loops 
  * whether the body of an if statement is ever reached, etc.
cons: 
* You have to add all the ouput manually.
* Since you're putting output where you think the bug might be, you're probably only finding the bugs you expect to find.

## Rubber Ducking

You've stepped through your code 20 times and can't see a problem. You ask someone for help, and as you start to explain your problem the realisation dawns: you've looked directly at the error 20 times and know exactly where it is. You've wasted their time.

{{< imgcard smokebomb>}}
There's nowhere to hide.
{{< /imgcard >}}

After a while a pattern emerges. Just the **attempt to explain the bug** helped you see it from a fresh perspective. You didn't need to invite anyone over, **you could have explained it to a rubber duck* and achieved the same outcome.

{{< imgcard rubberducking_trio >}}
We're listening.
{{< /imgcard >}}

## Digital God: The Debugger

The _debugger_ is on a whole other level. It lets you see inside your program, to slow it down to human speeds, stopping and starting it at your command.

{{< imgcard neo_stopping_bullets >}}
Be like Neo. See the matrix, control the matrix.
{{< /imgcard >}}

It can:
* See the programs variables, their types and their contents
* Stop and start execution, line by line
* See what literals like `0.06` and `b` are being treated as (`double` and `char`)
* Critically, you can follow the execution path and see if areas of your program (inside functions, loops, ifs) are ever reached.

{{< imgcard debugger_outcomes Link "debugger_outcomes.png">}}
No cout required: the <i>debugger</i> halting and looking inside the program in real time
{{< /imgcard >}}

### What Is The Debugger

It's a few things: 
* Mainly, it's another program that loads and sits in memory. 
  * It has special permission to access and change the memory given over to your program.
* It's the interface mode of Visual Studio that lets you interact with the debugger program
* It's also extra stuff compiled into your slots game that makes it possible.

### Exercise: Breakpoints And Step Through

* Step through simple program.
* Watch locals changed
* Watch an if statement
