## Assessment 1: Quiz

**Due:** Available to take from Friday, Module 4, until **11:55pm, Sunday, end of Module 4** (3 days).

<!--  

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://torrens.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_10262683_1&course_id=_116055_1" target="_blank">ONLINE: Exam and brief on Blackboard<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

Testing your understanding of the **ideas in programming**, along with knowledge of C++ **data types**, **operators**, **evaluation** and more. 

### Deliverable

An online exam you will complete **on Blackboard**. The exam will be available for 3 days - you can begin at any point from (and including) Friday of Module 4 until 11:55pm Sunday, end of Module 4.   

* Once started, you have to complete it the time specified (60 minutes)
* You can **return** to the exam **during** that time if your machine/internet goes down, but **not after**.  
* If a serious technical issue stops you from returning to it, please contact me.   
* The uni will require a legitimate reason, so make sure that when you sit down you have time to complete it without interruption from family/friends/responsibilities.  

{{< alert title="Preparation" color= "secondary" >}}
You will need to have 
1. Attended and/or watch recordings of **ALL of EVERY class**, and worked through the **exercises and homework**
2. Carefully read and understood the **first three chapters of the textbook up to and including for loops** (available on the resources page)
3. Worked through sololearn up to and including data types (tute 3).
4. Reading and quizzes won't get you far on their own: for these principles to stick you need to have written, **tested and experimented/played with code** from the textbook and the weekly lectures. 

Coding is like any other craft or science: if you don't practise, if you don't break it apart and put it back together, if you don't switch it around to see what happens, you won't learn it.

**#1 tip:** If you think you really understood the example you typed out and toyed with, close the project, create a new one and **rewrite it from memory.** If you don't get anything wrong first go, it's not a hard enough exercise!

## Assessment 2: Slot Machine

**Due:** 11:55pm, Sunday, end of module 8.

A text based slot machine using the C++ *console* template. A _prompt and response_ game loop.

### Deliverables

1. Follow the general instructions further down this page under [Delivering Replit Projects](#Delivering-Replit-projects) to create a zip of your project. This is just as you practised in Module 7's class.
2. Submit your zip file and Replit link on the submission page for Assessment 2 on Blackboard, linked below. 

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://torrens.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_10262686_1&course_id=_116055_1" target="_blank">Online Assessment 2 on Blackboard<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>


## Assessment 3: Realtime Game

**Due:** Sunday, 11:55pm, End of Module 12

<!--

 Make Snake! See the **brief provided on Blackboard** (in the assessments section discussed in *submission* below) but **also watch classes and reviews** to get all the important details. 

> It's not enough to simply read the brief and make a program - your work has to reflect and demonstrate profiency with practises taught in class and should use code provided to you. This assessment must be built on the base code provided in class (weeks 10/11).

--> 
<!--  

### What To Prioritise 

For a better grade,

***DON'T:*** Get caught up in making a multi-segment snake that can bite itself unless you have the full game experience described above.  

***DON'T:*** duplicate whole functions or sections of code and change just one or two things - that's what variables, if statements and function arguments are for.  

**DO:** Have a complete game. The player can gain points, lose the game (maybe hitting a wall or a poison fruit, and see how they did. They know what's happening because the game tells them how to play, what fruit can do to them, why they died etc.   

**DO:** Make sure your game doesn't look like what your facilitator gave out to you - consider colours, how you want information displayed. The gui section below the game should frame whatever is in it, so make it taller/shorter to suit your interface. Look at the week 9 notes for inspiration.   

**DO:** Add features like pause, play modes, options, help, creative kinds of fruit that maybe speed you up for 3 seconds (bad!) or slow you down for a few seconds (good!).   

**DO:** Use function arguments and variables when you add modes or options.  

**DO:** Attempt to add the moving snake and self biting if you have the rest done, have read about vectors in the notes, looked at the week 12 notes and feel confident about implementing it.  

### Deliverables 

1. Email your cleaned, zipped project to your facilitator **at the end of module 11**. This progress delivery matters, you can't catch up on this assessment in a week at the end!  
2. In week 12 your **entire** Visual Studio solution must be cleaned of unnecessary folders, zipped and submitted on Blackboard. You must follow the method taught in class and described/demonstrated in [Delivering Visual Studio Solutions](#delivering-visual-studio-solutions) below. DO NOT make a build and submit an additional build zip.    

### Submission

Submit your assessment by:
1. Visiting your subject's page on Blackboard
2. Selecting *Assessments* in the left nav 
3. Clicking on *Assessment 3 - OOP Principles Program*
4. Optional but wise: check your work fulfills the brief
5. Click *Assessment 3 - Submission* and follow the instructions.  
  
-->  

## Delivering _Replit_ projects

In addition to providing the link to your finished assessment on Replit, you'll provide a zipped archive of your project. 
1. The zip file is easily downloaded from the *kebab* menu in the *Files* panel, as in the screenshot below.
2. Rename the file using the following pattern:
   *ise102_AX_lastname_firstname.zip*
   Replace the *X* with the assessment number and add your own name.
   Example: *ise102_A2_mcgillick_danny.zip*
3. On Blackboard, navigate to the assessment submission page and submit:
   * a link to your Replit project online
   * the zip file.

{{< imgcard "17796C37-1C35-47ED-A1EE-F92F10EF9985">}}
"Download as Zip" is located yin menu at the top right of the **Files** section title bar
{{< /imgcard >}}


### Important!
**Do not make changes to the code after submission** - your replit history will identify any changes added and this will be 
- considered cheating if you *don't* notify your lecturer of changes
- considered a late delivery if you *do* notify your lecturer of changes.


## Delivering Visual Studio solutions
<a name="deliverable"> </a>

You'll deliver a **zip file** containing your Visual Studio solution. You DO NOT need to submit a build (with executable) as mentioned in the brief. Just a zip of your solution/project folder, as described below.

Work through the steps shown in the video carefully: if you miss submission requirements it will cost you easy marks.

{{< alert title="Correct zip name" color= "danger" >}}
**Ignore** the naming in the video. Use this, which matches the brief pdf:

**ISE102_AssessmentX_Lastname_Firstname.zip** where X is the assessment number (1, 2 or 3).
{{< /alert >}}

{{< youtube H44emolQCz4 >}}

{{< alert title="Where Is My Project Folder?" color= "secondary" >}}
With your project open in Visual studio:
  * Right click the project in the _solution explorer_
  * Click _Open folder in file explorer_. 
  * You'll see several files there, including your `.cpp` file.

If you have **a subfolder** in there with the name of your project, message me on Discord! **Do not move its contents or delete it**.
{{< /alert >}}

### What You Should Delete
Your project file might be several hundred MB in size! Meanwhile, the files you actually need are about 30-50KB in size. Let's delete what we don't need.

In your solution/project folder (same thing for us) you can **delete all** of these folders:
* _.vs_ 
    * visual studio will probably have to be closed for this one
    * If you can't see it, **turn on "hidden items"** in Windows explorer's *view* ribbon.
* _Debug_
* _Release_
* _x64_

{{< imgcard folder_cleaning>}}
Here are some of the folders you'd delete. DO NOT MOVE YOUR FILES if your folder is missing the proj files and cpp files. Contact me.
