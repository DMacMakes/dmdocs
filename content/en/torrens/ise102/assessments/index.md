Testing your understanding of the **ideas in programming**, along with knowledge of C++ **data types**, **operators**, **evaluation** and more. 

### Deliverable

An online exam you will complete **on Blackboard**. The exam will be available to start at any point from Friday of week 4 **until Sunday end of week 4**. 

* Once started, you have to complete it the time specified.
* You can **return** to the exam **during** that time if your machine/internet goes down, but **not after**.
* If a serious technical issue stops you from returning to it, please contact me. 
    * The uni will require a legitimate reason, so make sure that when you sit down you have time to complete it without interruption from family/friends/responsibilities.  

{{< alert title="Preparation" color= "secondary" >}}
You will need to have 
1. Attended and/or watch recordings of **ALL of EVERY class**, and worked through the **exercises and homework**
1. Carefully read and understood the **first two chapters of the textbook** (available on the resources page)
1. Work through sololearn.
1. Reading and quizzes won't get you far on their own: for these principles to stick you need to have written, **tested and experimented/played with code** from the textbook and the weekly lectures. 

Coding is like any other craft or science: if you don't practise, if you don't break it apart and put it back together, if you don't switch it around to see what happens, you won't learn it.

**#1 tip:** If you think you really understood the example you typed out and toyed with, close the project, create a new one and **rewrite it from memory.** If you don't get anything wrong first go, it's not a hard enough exercise!

## Assessment 2: Slot Machine

**Due:** End of week 8 *(April 11 for T1 2021)*

We'll make a text based slot machine using the C++ *console* template. A _prompt and response_ game loop.

If you're in the second online class (who joins the collaborate sessions via public link and watch recordings via Discord) this is your submission link:

### Deliverable 

You'll deliver a **zip file** containing your Visual Studio solution. You DO NOT need to submit a build (with executable) as mentioned in the brief. Just a zip of your solution/project folder, as described below.

Work through the steps shown in the video carefully: if you miss submission requirements it will cost you easy marks.

{{< alert title="Correct zip name" color= "danger" >}}
**Ignore** the naming in the video. Use this, which matches the brief pdf:

**ISE102_Assessment2_Lastname_Firstname.zip**
{{< /alert >}}

{{< youtube H44emolQCz4 >}}

{{< alert title="Where Is My Project Folder?" color= "secondary" >}}
With your project open in Visual studio:
  * Right click the project in the _solution explorer_
  * Click _Open folder in file explorer_. 
  * You'll see several files there, including your `.cpp` file.

If you have **a subfolder** in there with the name of your project, message me on Discord! **Do not move its contents or delete it**.
{{< /alert >}}

### What You Should Delete
Your project file might be several hundred MB in size! Meanwhile, the files you actually need are about 30-50KB in size. Let's delete what we don't need.

In your solution/project folder (same thing for us) you can **delete all** of these folders:
* _.vs_ 
    * visual studio will probably have to be closed for this one
    * If you can't see it, **turn on "hidden items"** in Windows explorer's *view* ribbon.
* _Debug_
* _Release_
* _x86_
* _x64_

{{< imgcard folder_cleaning>}}
Here are some of the folders you'd delete. DO NOT MOVE YOUR FILES if your folder is missing the proj files and cpp files. Contact me.
