<!-- First, what are functions and how do you use them? -->
## Doing the same thing, but different

In a **shooter** like _Battlefield_, _Overwatch_ or _Fortnight_, what are you doing a lot of? **Shooting**. Hitting things, missing things. Weapon switching, reloading. 

In a **platformer like _Super Mario Bros_** you do a lot of **jumping** and **colliding with things**. You **collect** who-knows-how-many items (coins, stars, mushrooms), and sometimes you **power up**.

{{< imgcard mario_actions >}}
Platforming actions
{{< /imgcard >}}

{{< alert title="Player Actions" color= "primary" >}}
A game, boiled down, is **a person performing a small set of actions, many times.** Actions which
* Have predictable properties (a jump goes this high, and higher if I hold the button)
* Occur in many different scenarios (off a platform, under a brick, onto an enemy)
* Produce outcomes appropriate (following the game rules and world physics) to their current scenario.
{{< /alert >}}

**You as a programmer** then, have to do the **same thing** a lot, but that same thing has to react **dynamically** to different inputs/environments.

### Way too many `if`s

Picture our little game loop in main: if we have to react dynamically to whatever button is pressed, under any circumstances, we're going to need **a loooot of conditionals**!

> If she presses jump, if _running_, if not riding yoshi, if has a mushroom power up, **do this**.
> If she presses jump, if _walking_, if not riding yoshi, if has a mushroom power up, **do this**.
> etc etc.

It'll mean a lot of **repetition** too.

## Reusable code: Functions

Functions are like little programs within your program, and they're written once to do a small, focussed job. 

You then call on them whenever you need that thing, say starting a jump, checking for a hit, calculating damage.

To use them:
1) Evoke them by name 
2) Give them some input (if they need it)
3) They do some things
4) They feed you back (usually) some output.

### Free functions!

> Writing functions save you a lot of work. Using someone else's functions though, that's even better!

Places we get free functions:
* Packaged with _C++_, in the _**Standard Library**_

{{< imgproc ceil_cppref Resize "300x" Link "http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/ceil/" >}}
Cplusplus.com reference for the <code>ceil()</code> function
{{< /imgproc >}}

* Our **work colleagues**, friends or teams we're making games with, Github, game engines, operating systems, drivers and many, many more.

### The Standard Library

The keywords of the language give you the basic building blocks to make whatever you need.  That leaves out a lot of everyday things you might need though like:
* reading files
* generating random numbers
* rounding off numbers
* trigonometry and much more.

The Standard Library functions are spread out in a number of library files, but all use the same `std` prefix.
1: **include** the right **header** like `#include <cmath>`
2: Either use `std::` or `using namespace std` to access the function. Now you know what that really means.

> To find which header holds the function, google like so: for absolute values (turn a negative positive) google "absolute value C++" and click [abs - C++ Reference - Cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/).

### Handy Math For Games

Here's Some very basic but very necessary math you don't want to have to code yourself.

| Function  | Header      | Description                                                   | Returns            | Link |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|
| **abs**   | cmath     | Takes a number, returns the **positive value**  (-2 becomes 2)  | int, float etc     | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/)     |
| **ceil**  | cmath     | Takes a decimal, returns **nearest higher** whole number        | float, double      | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/ceil/)    |
| **lround**| cmath     | Takes a decimal, returns **rounded** result, converted to int.  | int (use round for float) | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/round/)    |
| **pow**   | cmath     | Takes numbers a and b, returns **a to the power of b**          | double      | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/ceil/)    |
| **srand** | cstdlib   | Takes a number, **seeds** random number generator               | void                | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/srand/) |
| **rand**  | cstdlib   | Generates a **random number** from 0 to RAND_MAX                | unsigned int        | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/)  |
| **time**  | ctime     | **Time** in seconds since Jan 1 1970. Good seed for srand.      | time_t              | [docs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time/)    |

### Calling a function

You _call_ a function by writing its name followed by parentheses.

```cpp  
// Just focus on the part after `=`
int rand1 = rand();
```

### Passing data to a function

You _pass_ it input data, called _arguments_ or _parameters_ by putting variables or literals in the parentheses.

If you're asking someone to do a real world job for you, say get you something while they're on holiday, they need data! What is it, where can they find it, how much will it cost?

```cpp
/// print out the result of flooring (rounding down) the decimal `5.7`
cout << floor(5.7f);

/// Using `pow` to get the square of a number.
/// You can pass any data (variables, literals etc) to functions.
int x = 5;
int xSquared = pow(x, 2);
cout << xSquared;
```

**Output:**
>  5  
>  25  

### Do something with the return values!

A function (often) _returns_ a result, which has a data type (int, float) etc. In the code above, `pow(x,2)` is processed and returned `25`. This is just like a maths expression, say `5*2`, is processed into a result, `10`. It is only held in memory temporarily, and if not stored will be lost when you move on.

You want to do something useful with the return values like you would with the result of any expression:
* Store it in a variable or
* Print it to the console with `cout` or
* Use the result in another expression

```cpp
/// You wouldn't write this without printing or storing the result
5 * 2;      
/// ( The result, 10, evaporates.. )

/// So don't expect anything useful to happen if you do this:
roundl(3.6f);
/// ( The result, 3.0f, evaporates.. )

// Try storing the result
int nearestWhole = roundl(3.6f);    // Stores 3

// Printing the result
cout << "Nearest whole number to 3.6 is " << round(3.6f);

// Using the result in an expression, then storing the result of the expression.
// I'm using use the results in a simple calculation, averaging two numbers:
// Average of two numbers = (a + b) / 2
float roundedNumbersAverage = (roundl(3.6f) + roundl(1.2f)) / 2.0f;

```

## Functions for random numbers

C++, like most languages, offers functions that **generate random numbers** for you.

The most basic of them is `rand()`. Have a look at this definition of `rand()` from [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/).

{{< imgcard rand_cppref Link "http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/">}}
Click for more info.
{{< /imgcard >}}

## Exercise: Random code

[Type out and run the code below on JDoodle.com.](https://www.jdoodle.com/online-compiler-c++17/)

{{< imgcard rand1_code_jdoodle Link "https://www.jdoodle.com/online-compiler-c++17/">}}Printing the random number and the range of numbers possible.{{< /imgcard >}}

Now, edit the code to create and print 3 random numbers. 

> Hints: Keep it simple, don't use a loop for now. Another `int` called `rand2` might help. 

### Not that random.

You might have noticed by now that your random numbers, though pretty random are **always the same** 3 randoms.

> "That's not very random." - everyone.

{{< alert title="Deterministic machines" color= "primary" >}}
Before starting his rounds in the hospital cardiac ward, Nurse Feng has to calculate the dosage of heart medication for one of his patients. He enters `high blood pressure`, `female` and `66kg`. The machine outputs:
> Verapamil, 5mg. (high bp, female, 60-70kg)
Just to be safe, he runs it again
> Verapamil, 26mg. (high bp, female, 60-70kg)

Clearly, computers that gave different results each time you run the same calculation would be **very very bad**. 

This is why computers are designed to be _deterministic systems_: if you start at the same point, with the same data, and take the same steps, you can expect the same outcome.
{{< /alert >}}

### Psuedo-randomness

Computers, then, are actually bad at being random, because everything about their design had one main goal: stopping anything random happening! 

This is one reason we call `rand()` a **pseudo-random number generator**. It can generate a long series of seemingly random numbers, but it has to start somewhere and it always does that the same way.

### Seeding

We can **change the starting point** of the random calculation.

A **_seed_** is a number we feed to the computer something it doesn't control. 

We can start with something pulled from thin air, like `10`.
* `rand()` doesn't just accept a seed argument ðŸ˜¢
* Instead we can pass 10 to `srand()`.  

{{< imgproc rand1_b_code Resize "1280x" Link "rand1_b_code.png">}}
New seed, new result?
{{< /imgproc >}}

Try adding it to your 3 number generator, like i've done below for rand1. You only need to call it once.

### New problems 

Run it a few times. What's wrong?? 

Now we have the respsibility of feeding `srand()` a different value whenever we start our program. It sounds like we've circled back to the same problem.. but **the number we feed in doesn't have to be random, just different each time**. 

* We'll use a very basic one: the current time (to the second).

<!-- end learning how to just USE functions -->
{{< alert title="Function: definition and synonyms" color= "primary" >}}
A section of a computer program that is **defined only once** but can be **called on when needed**. 

Though we'll (mostly) call them functions, they have several names across programming languages. Even within _C++_ you'll hear more than one. 

The most common are:
* method
* procedure
* routine
* subroutine
* subprogram
  
Are there any **you know** that aren't listed here?
{{< /alert >}}

## Making your own functions

You can define them to handle whatever job you need done, then call them whenever needed. You can hand them new data to work on each time, and grab their results to use or pass to other functions to get even more done.

They're easy to create because they have the same basic components as their parent programs: input, storage, processing and output.

The function `twoTimes` takes a number and multiplies it by 2:

### Declaring a function

**Just like a variable**, a function needs to be _declared_. We have to tell _C++_ what it's **named**, what input it **accepts**, and what type of data it's going to **return**.
* Like a variable, you write the _type_ followed by the _name_
* Unlike a variable, you put **parentheses on the end** to tell C++ it's a function.

```cpp
// Declaring a function that returns my age as an int 
int myAge();
```

If your function will accept inputs, you declare those in the parentheses

```cpp
// Declaring a function that multiply any (integer) input value by two and return the (integer) result.
int twoTimes ( int inputValue );
```

### Defining the function body

Just like a variable without a value isn't much use, a function without any code isn't much use.

To make it useful, you have to _define_ the function body in curly braces `{}`. Just like code blocks for `if`, `for` and `while`, it can hold new variables (storage) and statements (processing).

Here we'll **declare and define** twoTimes:

![](function_twoTimes_code.png)

The **output** or result of a function is called the **return value**. That's what will take the place of the function call when it has been processed

![call twoDozen](call_twoDozen_code.png)

### Exercise: Creating the twoTimes program.

Using the code outline below and the real code above, create the *two_times* program in Visual Studio.

```cpp
#include <??????>  // Put the include needed for cout here.

// Declare and define twoTimes here

int main ()
{
  // call twotimes from here, with an argument, and store the value.

  // Print out a message, include the result from the call to 2X
}
```
The program should produce this output:

![twoDozen output](twoDozen_output.png)

## Assessment 2 and homework

## Randoms in range 1: Integer remainder

In integer division, **dividing a by b,** produces a _**quotient**_, or how many times b divided **evenly** into a.

The left over amount is the **remainder**. As you know, **a modulo b** gives us that.  

> a / b = quotient  
> a % b = remainder 

### A pattern emerges:

If we keep dividing a by 3 what becomes obvious about the `b` and the remainder?

|  a / b  | quotient | remainder |  
|------|----------|------|  
| 6 / 3 | 2 | **0** |  
| 7 / 3 | 2 | **1** |  
| 8 / 3 | 2 | **2** |  
| 9 / 3 | 3 | **0** |  
| 10 / 3 | 3 | **1** |  
| 11 / 3 | 3 | **2** |  
| 12 / 3 | 3 | **0** |

It looks like for **any value of a**, `a % b` produces a number from `0` to `b-1` before it divides evenly again.

{{< alert title="Rule: Maximum Remainder Size" color= "primary" >}}
For any value of `a`, the **maximum remainder** of `a/b` is `b-1`.
{{< /alert >}}

### Producing a range from 0 to n

```cpp
/// The rule above says anything % b maxes out at b minus one
betweenZeroAndB_minus_one = anything % b;    

/// So a % (b+1) gives us something from 0 to b right? 
// Try 7 % (3+1).. which is 7 % 4.. remainder is 3. It works!
betweenZeroAndB = anything % (b + 1)

// Then for any random at all..
randomBetweenZeroAndB = rand() % (b+1);
```

{{< imgcard modulus_11_over_3 >}}
There are <b>3</b> sets of 3 balls. <b>2</b> are left over. If we add one more.. it becomes 4 groups of three, with no leftovers.
{{< /imgcard >}}

---

## Randoms in range 2: Ratios

A decimal between 0 and 1 is the ratio version of a percentage. If you multiply it by 100, you get the more recognisable percentage 0-100.

**0.5 of something is 50%**, 0.1 is 10%, 0.99 is 99% etc.

At school you turned a **fraction** into a decimal **ratio** by dividing the top by the bottom:  

| Fraction  | Ratio  |  Percentage (ratio*100)  |  
|------------|----------------------|-----------|  
| 1/2   | 0.5   | 50%   |  
| 1/4   | 0.25  | 25% |  
| 2/4   | 0.5   | 50% |  
| 3/4   | 0.75  | 75% |  

So if we have a number **x** between **0** and a range's upper limit (**max**imum) we can figure out the ratio:  

```cpp
ratio = x / max;
```

### Converting your ratio to a new range

Once you **have a ratio**, you can easily express it as a number **y** in a new range: 

**Multiply** the **ratio** by the **new** range **max**.

```cpp
y = ratio * new_max;
```

> 6 eggs in a carton that holds a dozen:  
> _6/12 = 0.5 (50%)_  

| Ratio  | Max  |  Ratio * Max = y  |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 0.5 | 4   | **2** |
| 0.5 | 100 | **50** |
| 0.5 | 20  |**10** |


### In C++

```cpp
/// We already have accessto the maximum value
/// of our random through RAND_MAX.
int randomValue = rand();

// `r = x / max` gives us a ratio so:
float ratio = (float)randomValue / (float)RAND_MAX;

// So if we want it as a number from 0 to 10
int outOf10 = ratio * 10;

// We had to use (float) before each variable to force c++ to do
// do floating point division. Otherwise it uses integer division.
// Any decimal from 0 to 1 would be cut down to 0.
```

## Homework

{{< alert title="Homework is part of assessment 2" color= "danger" >}}
On-time submission of weekly homework is part of assessment 2. Non-submission (or low effort submissions) will **impact your final mark.**
{{< /alert >}} 

It consists of assigned reading and two code projects. **Submit** your two `.cpp` files (calculate_more and random_range)  **by the end of Saturday.**

### 1: Reading

Read [Chapter 5](../resources/cpp_through_games_5.pdf), pages **143 to 153**. You can stop when you reach 'Working with scopes'. 

{{< imgproc cpp_through_games Resize "200x" Link "../resources/cpp_through_games_5.pdf" >}}
<b>Click to download</b> Chapter 5.
{{< /imgproc >}}

{{< alert title="Separating declaration and definition" color= "primary" >}}
You can **declare a function before main()** (like a variable declaration) and **define the body after**. 

Be ready to see this in the textbook. Functions will be your bread and butter from now on, so get your head around them!
{{< /alert >}}

### 2: Calculate_more

Two times calculator is a bit limited. **Create a new project** called *calculate\_more*. You can copy+paste the code from the old calculator's `.cpp` file as a starting point.

Instead of two times calculation, **give the program the features below**:
* Ask the player to input a multiplier (int) and store it.
* Also ask them for a multiplicand (int) and store it
* Calculate the product by calling a "multiply" function which takes the two numbers as _arguments_ and returns an _int_. Store that value.
* Print the product.

**Mathematical terminology** for `a * b = c`:
> **multiplier** * **multiplicand** = **product**  

(from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication))
 
### 3: Random_range

**Create a new project** called _Random\_range_. In it you'll make a function called `randInRange()`. When you call it and pass an integer `rangeMax`, it'll return a random in the range `0` to `rangeMax` inclusive.

I've written the structure, it's up to you to replace the missing code. _Note: The lines (\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_) don't always match the length of the answer._

{{< imgcard hw_rand_code_gaps Link "hw_rand_code_gaps.png">}}{{< /imgcard >}} 

The output (with your own program name) should look like this:

{{< imgcard hw_rand_range_output Link "hw_rand_code_gaps.png">}}{{< /imgcard >}} 

{{< alert title="That random code" color= "primary" >}}
The approach you use to change your random from the default range `0`-`RAND_MAX` to the custom range `0`-`range_max` is up to you. Use either technique from the section above (By remainder or ratio), whichever made more sense. Or do it your own way.
