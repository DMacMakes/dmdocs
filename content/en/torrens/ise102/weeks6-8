# Ensuring Assessment 2 preparedness

Getting us from here to slot machine in 3 weeks.

- Describe slot machine on Assessments page
- Discuss with class
- Game loop in game loop template, show a little centralised function calling/data handling. Make a graphic.
- Teach about scope, breaking up a problem. Find a good video.
- 

## Week 6

  - Talk about assessment
  - Template to build from? Bringing together things we made?
  - Links to resources each week about implementation: switch, rand, srand, betting rules, clearing screen, laying out in ascii.
