## Last Week's Homework

Madballs: 2 hours of try-harding.

Q&A
1. What was easy to do on Madballs in ZBrush?
2. What was hard to do in zbrush?
3. Got stuck in a weird mode?

Today we'll learn to do things that were hard with the basic subdividing workflow.

(Doing stuff close together, clean work with crisp transitions, eyeballs and eyelids!)

-->  

## What are we learning today?

You'll learn how to:
* make cleaner, more professional looking models.
* create a wider variety of silhouettes and shapes 
  * without worrying about stretching
  * without needing as many divisions
* work from basemeshes for fast, clean, on-model results

## Assessment 1: Character Sculpt
Look at order of assessments, brief.

## Beyond Pushing Clay
More than just adding and removing clay. Now we take advantage of digital tools.

### How To Add Eyeballs And Eyelids!

Sometimes having everything in one mooshy, continuous mass makes life hard. Consider eyes:

<!-- ## ---------- BETTER IMAGE?? ----------- -->  

{{< imgcard moana_disney Link "https://www.pinterest.com.au/dmacdraws/aac202/">}}
Moana's lower lids are more visible as she looks upward. Also visible are the thick edges of her upper lids.
{{< /imgcard >}}

* **Eyeballs**, apart from a bump on the front, are **perfectly round**, glossy balls. 
    * Maintaining perfect shapes is hard in sculpting.
* **Eyelids** criss cross them at strange angles depending on expression and genetics.
    * Humans are sensitive to the slightest movement of eyelids and brows.
    * As a modeller you need to change them constantly.

To freely modify one while leaving the other perfect, **we need different surfaces**.

{{< imgproc bust_chef_pixar Resize "500x" Link "https://www.pinterest.com.au/dmacdraws/aac202/">}}
This real clay chef sculpt from Pixar is extremely stylised. You can see the eyes and lids are not sculpted out of the main mass.

### Tools and Subtools

To access the new files in _ZTools_ we'll start ZBrush and use the _lightbox_. It usually opens when ZBrush starts. If it doesn't, hit comma `,` or click the _lightbox_ button, top left.

{{< imgproc lightbox Resize "800x">}}
Projects, models, materials, brushes that don't load with ZBrush can be loaded from the lightbox.
{{< /imgproc >}}

## Modelling from existing base mesh

A base mesh is essentially a reusable block out: a whole made out of smaller, simpler pieces.
- don't have to worry about joining and topology
- can edit pieces safely without messing up neighbouring anatomy.

Brice Laville Saint Martin doing it:

{{< youtube "Ay-UY6JTbF4" >}}

### Let's look at his basemesh ðŸ‘Œ

* Open the 1mCube starting file in `Lightbox->Projects`
* Select a star or cylinder tool from tool palette
* Go to `Lightbox->Tools->Base Meshes` and double click `Brice_Head.ztl`

### Pipehead

Here's one I've started in my spare time, using the Brice base to model a Max Grecke concept. We'll open and look at the modified mesh.

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="pipehead_demo.zip" target="_blank">Download pipehead_demo.zip<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

### Load and save subtools

A Tool can have multiple subtools. While you're in a ZBrush project you can load in new ones or save them out. 
1. Let's load our whole, merged pipehead from a ztl file.
2. Load pipehead again, this time as separate subtools from another ztl file.

{{< imgproc subtools_jaw Resize "800x">}}
Jaw is a subtool of our character tool. Note the ear subtool has two meshes.

| Category |  Definition/Place                            |
|-----|-----                                              |
| Tools | Objects in the Tools palette.                   |
| Subtools | Objects in the Subtools list                 |
| Meshes   | Shells of contiguous polygons. Found inside subtools. |

#### Importing Subtools

{{< alert title="Definition: Subtools" color= "primary" >}}
A bit like objects in Maya. Can have multiple meshes.
{{< /alert >}}

# ---- REPLACE - Not a useful file. ----

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="hornhead_sketch_class.zip">Download hornhead_sketch_class.zip<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i>
</a>

1. Download My Madball Demo File
2. Unzip, it contains `madball_demo.zpr` and `eyes.ztl` files. 
3. Open `madball_demo.zpr`
5. Click `tool->subtool->append` and choose the `polysphere3D`.

### Basemesh vs Team Fortress 2 Spy

You'll need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract this one. Reference included.

## Exercise

Fool around with the brice base mesh.

#### Moving With The Gizmo

The  gizmo is like the Maya transform manipulators.
* Press `w` to use it (or `e` or `r`)
* Press `q` to return to brushing
* If you see a weird line with circled ends instead of gizmo, press `y` to switch.

{{< imgproc gizmo Resize "300x" >}}
The Gizmo and its menu.
{{< /imgproc >}}
  
Gizmo tool moving things
	* Individually
	* As a group
	* Locking/unlocking and changing the gizmo pivot `alt` or gizmo edit widget (like `d` in Maya`)
	* Back to center of visible objects
	* Can scale/rotate also.

* Modifying eyes
  	* Deforming with gizmo (`w`)
  	* We have one subtool for eyes and eyelids. How work on eyelids without messing up eye
  	* Back to Sculpt/Draw: `q`
  	* Move brush `b, m, v`
      	* masks (in draw mode)
        		* `ctrl-left drag` to mask out
        		* `ctrl-left drag` on background, not touching model, to clear mask.
        		* `ctrl-left click` on background to flip mask.
    		* With automask polygroup (in brush menu)
      			* View popugroups with shift F
    		* automask topological
    		* masking with ctrl
    		* Now try Move Elastic `b, m, e`

### Exercise: Madball Eyes

Re-do them on your model.

<!-- ### Joining The Pieces

Dynamesh is a magical tool that didn't exist in ZBrush until it was over 15 years old. Everything changed for cartoony artists, concept artists. You could truly experiment and explore whole creatures in ZBrush with little friction.

It'll be hard to see, but Brice merges everything with Dynamesh around 0:25. After that, you'll see the seams and cleanup. He's meticulous.

{{< imgcard brice_tao_dynamesh Link "brice_tao_dynamesh.jpg">}}
Captured frame where he looks at the new topology. Teeny tiny quads.

Then Iâ€™ll dynamesh (give settings) and start cleaning up with sculptris (give settings).

###  Ways To Generate/Merge Geometry

Show girl face vid by follygon, then the brice saville one.
Approaches: 
Follygon: traditional clay, very steoke intensice
Brice: digital realm specific: block out low and clean, minimal final sculpting

### Concepts

Don't pick blue octopus guy, he requires too many extra models or too much subdividing of the unsuitable jaw mesh.

### Staying low subdiv
