## Welcome back

..and hello new people!

* Modern, current-generation 3D graphics.
* Learning Maya, ZBrush, some Substance.
* Immerse yourself in modeling. Practise always, just like drawing.
* Get your hands on a wacom or other drawing tablet! From week 5 we'll be using it every class and for homework.
* Assessments.

### Recap

ACR103: 
  - Low poly modeling
    - Blocking out
    - Detailing
  - Rendering
  - UV unwrapping
  - Hand painted textures

## High detail modeling

This semester we're going to be working towards current-gen assets, with techniques that apply to both cartoony and realistic models.

Round vs sharp, countour control!

Last trimester our goal was to make **low surface detail** props, using **hundreds of triangles**. To make up for the lacking geometry, we'd use [diffuse](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-NormalDiffuse.html) textures, flat hand-painted images. Something like you see here:

**High detail** meshes can be made many ways and are **defined differently** depending on whether you're making games or film, whether the year's 2005 or 2020 and so on. Then those high poly details are brought into games using some tricks that we'll worry about that later.

The end goal of adding polygons is to support **smoothly curving surfaces** and **fine details**.

More barrels can be found on my [aac202 Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com.au/dmacdraws/aac202/).

You could work toward high detail assets using our low poly process but.. on its own it would take a looong time. 

## Download And Install ZBrush

* Using 30 day trial for now:
* Working on floating licenses outside uni

## Digital Sculpting?

* What is sculpture (some classical, modern pics)
* Isn't Maya 3D sculpting?
  * Technically, sure
  * In practise it's focussed on points and edges and faces It uses transforms.
  * Generally useful in the < 100K polygons space
(One pic of Maya with smoothed object, maybe joystick)

* ZBrush 
  * Focussed on smooshing and building and carving surfaces
  * Provides tools  a sculptor would recognise
  * Tries to automate the polygon part away
  * Happily works with millions of "polygons" by using a different paradigm internally

### From Film To Games

Many wrinkly monsters, festy zombies and gnarled trees in film have been created with ZBrush.

* When it was first made, games couldn't integrate ZB level 3D except in cinematics
* Won Oscar for contribution to film effects
* GPU accelerated normal maps came along, you could now steal the details from those high res models and approximate them on game models.
* Unreal engine (and whatever doom 3 was on??)

### Doom 3

## Intro to ZBrush

Using ZBrush on the uni computers or your own.

* Open a **STARTING SCENE I PROVIDE**
* Import the settings I give out (basic right click nav, not saving undo)
* Navigate
  - Right drag tumble
  - Right drag shift snap top/front/left etc
  - alt-right-drag pan
  - ctrl-right-drag zoom
* Save settings.

First marks:
* On provided sphere
* Standard brush: `b, s, t`
* Dam standard: `b, d, s`
* Move brush: `b, m, v`

{{< imgcard brushes_default Link "brushes_default.jpg" >}}
What you'll see when you press `b`
{{< /imgcard >}}

Brush controls:

Press space to access brush controls near the cursor.

{{< imgcard space_menu >}}
{{< /imgcard >}}

Adding mass:
* Still on sphere
* Clay buildup `b, c, b`
* Inflate `b, i, n`
* Smooth brush `shift`
* Snake hook `b, s, h`

More cleaning, subtools:
* Trim Dynamic `b, t, d`
* HPolish `b, h`
* Pinch (on dam standard) `b, p, i`
* Switch to cube subtool, solo.
* trim dynamic, hpolish the corners
* Now smooth, pinch

Pixelation?? Subdivision up down
* Subdivide: `Ctrl + D`
* Step up, down `d`, `shift+d`

## Free play

Play around and make a madball for 25 mins. 

Screenshot it and post it in the Discussion forums:

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_94273_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_170634_1&forum_id=_902732_1&message_id=_2307470_1" target="_blank">Thread: class madball<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

## More Basics

Auto masking:
* switch to skinny object
* Show how sculpting damages back faces
* Backface auto masking
* Inflate brush (without backface mask)

Different Materials:
* how materials affect our perception: detail pops when shiney, not matte.
* Stylised materials a little
* Colours vs material

Getting Out Of Trouble
* things aren't moving - Lost edit mode (hit t)
* 

Watch out:
* Exiting edit mode by mistake (T)
* Getting back into it.

## Due This Week

Pick a different Madball (the real foam ball, not a 2D  drawing from their site) and sculpt it as faithfully as you can in 2 hours. Do starting from the base sphere provided in `Trying_Out_Brushes.zpr`. If you already overwrote that file working on the class Madball, get a fresh copy from [aac202_zbrush_resources.zip](aac202_zbrush_resources.zip).  Use brushes like the standard, dam standard, pinch, inflate, move, hpolish and smooth to reproduce the  clean surfaces and creases. 

{{< alert title="Deliverables and Submission" color= "primary" >}}

Post the **reference** of your chosen madball along with some **screenshots of the finished sculpt** in the Discussion forum. Have it done and posted **before next week's class**.

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_94273_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_170634_1&forum_id=_902732_1&message_id=_2307472_1" target="_blank">Thread: Home madball submission<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

{{< /alert >}}

_**Bonus:**_ ZBrush has a super helpful filter called **Clay Polish**. Look it up in the zbrush documentation or on youtube. To try it out, add some random shapes to your free-play sculpt and hit Clay Polish. For this kind of sculpt it's a bit of a magic "make art" button.

#### Great sculpts

A playlist of great sculpts, many of them timelapsed to <10 mins. Most of them were added over a year ago but they're no less great.
