# Homework review

## Main issues with knights journey

This first homework is kept simple (just typing out) so we can figure out all the other misunderstandings/mistakes that come with homework submission. We'll get that sorted now and we can start to focus on code.

* **Wrong project:** Students sending game over project. Read the brief carefully
* **Email subject name:** Pretty varied! 
* No comments written
* Sending the in class work instead of the homework (no cin input)
* **Wrong file:** send cpp, not sln
