## 1. High Poly Character 

**Due:** End of week 4  

**Create a bust from an existing 2D concept:**   
1. Select one of the heads from the concept art [below](#concepts)    
2. Starting with a clean copy of the provided base mesh, sculpt a high quality, polypainted 3D model of the character. Draw on what you've learned in your first attempt plus your week 3 ZBrush class (polypaint, merging, dynamesh).  
3. **Progress Delivery:** Before your **Module 3 review** session, show your progress in the week 3 forum thread. Your participation and display of process **is worth 30% of total marks** for this assessment.   
> If a link to Blackboard takes you to the "Student Access/Staff Access" page, it will then go straight to the Blackboard homepage instead of the original destination (such as discussion boards). Once you have a blackboard tab open in your browser, try those links again and they should work. This is because you are logged out whenever you close the last browser window/tab containing a blackboard page.

4. **Final Delivery:** Deliver your final ZBrush project and renders at the end of **Module 4** for the **remaining 70%** as described below.  
  
{{< alert title="Final (Module 4) Delivery" color= "primary" >}}  
  
**Elements:**  
1. Your final **ZPR file**  
2. **Renders** (`shift+r`) of your character from multiple angles, with polypaint on.  
   * **Side, front, back** (with perspective enabled: press `p`)  
   * A **beauty render 3/4 angle** to show off the character. You can polish it a bit in photoshop.  
   * Don't have the character tiny in the middle of the canvas. Move zbrush to your largest screen and have the character take up most of the canvas.  

**Zipping and delivering:**  
1. Put your beauty render, other ZB screenshots and your final ZPR file in a folder.  
2. **Rename that folder** `AAC202_A1_Lastname_Firstname` and archive it with zip or 7zip.  
3. The file is likely large, so use the Torrens LFS to upload it. If you haven't used it, instructions are at [the end of this page](#torrens-large-file-system).   
4. Submit on Blackboard under **Assessment 3** (Character model)

### Concepts  
Choose one of the concepts below, or click one and visit Patri Balanovsky's page to pick another **from the same artstation page** (not all of his artstation content). Be careful not to pick one that requires extra meshes (hair, horns, eyepatches) if you're not confident creating new meshes. Don't stretch the head to support large horns, hair etc.

### Some polishing ideas:
  * Cropping to a nice composition
  * Warming/cooling shadows, maybe improving the contrast
  * Adding rim light  
  * Adding gloss/specular hilight/shine to some elements
  * Painting in eyelashes and eyebrows that you didn't have geometry for

## 3. Hard surface model: NES Controller   

**Due:** End of week 12

Model the NES pad as close as you can to completion. Focus on controlling the silhouettes and sharpness/softness of transitions between surfaces.  

![Nes pad](nes_pad.jpg)

More info on level of detail and finish is [available below](#level-of-detail).

### What to submit

Create a zip file named *aac202_a3_Lastname_Firstname.zip* containing the following.

* Renders/screenshots showing your finished model off from varous angles, including closeups where they help.
* At least one beauty render, preferably composited and polished.
* Your final ZPR project file.

### Delivery

While this our third assessment, you'll be delivering it to the *Assessment 1* section on Blackboard.  Upload your zip file to Torrens LFS (instructions below) and submit your link to Blackboard:

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://torrens.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_10330016_1&course_id=_120652_1" target="_blank">ONLINE Prop Model/NES Controller Submission<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

#### Level of detail

Element       | Detail
---- | ----
Objects | Focus on using edge loops and creases to **control all the silhouettes and contours** as well you can. Use **booleans** to cut openings around the buttons so they don't merge into solid plastic. In those places where you can see inside the model, put black blocking objects inside to **prevent seeing through**. Use **real subdivisions and alphas** to add embossed details to the d pad, and **noise maker** to add realistic bumpy finish to the graphics inset (bit with the button names). 
Materials | At a minimum use the ZBro Paint matcap. Try other materials to see if you can represent the glossy red plastic and metal screws better. 
Color | If using ZBro paint, at a minimum fill with flat colour. You can add more subtle aging and colouration with polypaint if you like. If you use metal matcaps or pre-coloured plasticy matcaps, you might need to fill with just white to get the right result.

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="../week9/#assessment-3-rock-n-wood" target="_blank">Concept in Week 9 Notes<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i></a>

### Deliverable 1:
Images, answers to questions, comments on classmates work in the discussions for:
  * [week 9](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_89547_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_152757_1&forum_id=_866561_1&message_id=_2243100_1) and  
  * [week 10](https://laureate-au.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_89547_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_152757_1&forum_id=_866562_1&message_id=_2100668_1)   
  
  **Deliverables and guidelines** are in the **first post** in each thread.

### Deliverable 2:  

Watch the step-by-step tutorial provided in the [finishing section of the week 12 notes](https://dmdocs.netlify.app/torrens/aac202/week12/#finishing). Create the required work, and submit the LFS file link on Blackboard.

{{< alert title="Submitting Your Files" color= "primary" >}}
1. Put your beauty render, other ZB screenshots (described below) and your final ZPR file in a folder.
2. **Rename that folder** `AAC202_A3_Lastname_Firstname`, zip it up.
3. Use the Torrens LFS to upload it (instructions at bottom of page).
4. Submit the link on the Blackboard submission page.
{{< /alert >}}

**Images**
1. Using orb's method of rendering and then compositing in photoshop, **produce one final beauty render** of your model from what you feel is the best angle to show it off. Make sure it's not tiny on screen, we need resolution.
   - I'd first investigate if the angle in the concept art is best, it may well be. 
   - Export the image from photoshop (File - Export - Export As) as a 24 bit png.
2. Take some screenshots of renders done within zbrush (shift-r) as well, showing off your work from various angles/zoom. **No more than 4** screenshots.
