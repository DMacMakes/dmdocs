Might need better example, something from meet mat if anyone released?
  - Examples don't have to be all spp files.. Just pieces that create curiosity about how to do things.
  - Meet Mat examples are up on sketchfab

## What's Substance Painter like?

Opening some files in Substance and seeing what a project looks like. What, roughly, does an artist do there to texture meshes?

### Sample file.

Open a file.
The [spiderbot?](https://academy.substance3d.com/courses/Getting-Started-with-Substance-Painter-2021/youtube--ZbmRsOnApk)

{{< alert title="Painter GPU warning" color= "primary" >}}
Painter will ask you to change a few windows settings so the GPU can do longer tasks. 

*You can only do this if you're on your own computer. This lab machines won't allow you to make registry changes. If you're on a lab pc, just click continue.*

If you're on your own PC, click the URL in the popup dialogue for more info, and click the quit button in the Painter warning dialogue. You'll be creating or updating these entries in the Windows registry:

{{< /alert >}}

## Homework

### Read PBR Guide part 1. 

You can visit the html version of part 1, or read it in the all-in-one PDF.

Guide parts | Format
---- | ----
[Part 1](https://academy.substance3d.com/courses/the-pbr-guide-part-1) - Light and matter | Online 
[Parts 1 and 2](https://academy-api.substance3d.com/courses/b6377358ad36c444f45e2deaa0626e65/attachments/2b57526e-4bf3-4fd6-ae88-e9a9313a35cc) - All in one | PDF download 

### Watch Part 1 of Getting Started

I've gathered a Youtube playlist of Adobe's free learning material. [How to Substance Painter 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWza-ietxywun4izsjHG6A69i-aLROK4)  

![Getting started](substance_getting_started.png)

Watch [the intro and then part 1 of getting started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZbmRsOnApk&list=PLfWza-ietxywun4izsjHG6A69i-aLROK4&index=1) and try some of the things you see there. Add some materials, mask some things. *(Haven't yet confirmed this can be done in 2019.3.3 with provided project files)* 

[How to Substance Painter 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfWza-ietxywun4izsjHG6A69i-aLROK4)  

You can grab the [spider bot project files too](https://academy-api.substance3d.com/courses/88047015-c97e-48e8-9654-be65ca7c9809/attachments/ac082bf7-d343-4e1a-afd5-3edd4b4af287) \(268mb\)  



If the 2021 version turns out too radically different to 2019.3.3 and you can't find things it shows in the interface (or figure out where they went), there is this playlist of the previous introduction vides from 2018:

There's other free learning material up on Substance Academy, and plenty of paid great guides to specific kinds of texturing on Gumroad, Flipped Normals.
