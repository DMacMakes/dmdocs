## Software

You'll need a few software packages on your pc, whether it's your home pc for assesments or a laptop you're bringing to class.

### ZBrush

_ZBrush_ is a digital sculpting application that provides an experience similar to working with clay, rather than building from rectangles. **For now we'll be using the free trial,** as I.T. are tied up with the online transition.  Sign up, download and follow the instructions to start your trial:

### Custom UI, Brushes, Materials

### Maya 2020

Autodesk provides their industry standard 3D software to students. Sign up, download _Maya_ and use the serial number they provide.

### Image editor

You'll also need to be able to create/edit images 

Photoshop is preferred and will be demonstrated in class. Krita is a quality, free alternative.

### Substance Painter

Like _Maya_, _**Substance Painter**_ is available free to students once you've signed up.

### Pureref

Opening your reference and concepts in Pureref throughout a project is key to good finished work.

You can choose **installer or portable** from the dropdowns on the download page. A portable version just unzips to a folder.

| Computer    | What to download |
|-------------|------------------|
| laptop/home pc | installer      |
| uni lab pc     | portable version |
