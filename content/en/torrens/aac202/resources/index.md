## Software

You'll need a few software packages on your pc, whether it's your home pc for assesments or a laptop you're bringing to class.

## ZBrush

ZBrush in action

_ZBrush_ is a digital sculpting application that provides an experience similar to working with clay, rather than building from rectangles. **For now we'll be using the free trial,** as I.T. are tied up with the online transition.  Sign up, download and follow the instructions to start your trial:

### Custom ZBrush ui and resources

The zip contains:
  - a custom user interface file (.cfg)
  - a hotkey file (TXT)
  - A `ZBrush 2020` folder full of resources (brushes, materials, basemeshes)

{{< alert title="Installing the resources" color= "secondary" >}}

1. Unzip to a new folder.
2. Go to the folder, look for a `ZBrush 2020` folder, open that.
3. Select and copy everything inside (*ZProjects, ZStartup, ZTools, wintab32.dll*)with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
4. Open another explorer window and navigate to `C:\Program Files\Pixologic\ZBrush 2020` (or wherever you installed it, including maybe `Pixologic\ZBrush 2021`, or on `D:\` drive) and you should see a lot of folders, and most of them start with *Z*. **Paste** into this folder with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>
5. Run ZBrush 2020 and, in the lightbox, double-click the 1mCube project to open it.
6. In the menu select *Preferences - Config - Load Ui* and load the `.cfg` file (it's in the same unzipped folder where you found `ZBrush 2020`, open it. The interface should change.
7. Click *Preferences - Config - Store Config* to make sure the changes stick.
8. Select *Preferences - Hotkeys - Load* and load the hotkeys TXT file from the unzipped folder. It should open that folder by default this tome.
9. You can test if the hotkeys loaded properly by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> - the Damien Standard brush should become active.
10. Click *Preferences - Hotkeys - Store* to make sure the changes stick.

You'll also need to be able to create/edit images
