## Style in video games.

### Defining terms
When we all hear the same words all the time, we tend to define them the same way and like to agree about it.

#### *Realistic* game art:
Element | Approach
--- | ---
**Characters, props and environments** | Have lots of fine, life-like detail referenced from real life. Cloth wrinkles, tree bark, anatomy and wear/dirt/damage are mostly laid out in according with the laws of physics/biology/material science, with little/no regard for rhythm, contrast, readability.  
**Lighting** | Comes from sources available in the environment and is reflected by objects in accordance with the properties of their real life counterparts, or the closes thing if we're dealing with fantasy/sci fi.  
**Post effects/filters\*** | Will usually enhance detail and contrast but in line with film grading of movies/tv. They'll often recreate the physical properties of lenses, and the way cameras are affected by light and the environment.

#### *Stylized* game art  

Element | Approach
--- | ---
**Characters, props and environments** | Often have only as much detail as is required to communicate broadly the nature of their surface and materials. Cloth wrinkles, tree bark, anatomy and wear/dirt/damage are often rendered in a simplified way, sufficient to communicate their nature, and often grouped, altered or exaggerated to add contrast, improve readability, add appeal and rhythm.  
**Lighting** | May come from sources available in the environment but also from hidden lights, or extra lighting is implied in shaders. It will often be reflected by objects in ways that are correct on some level but also exaggerated/simplified to improve our ability to read silhouettes, distinguish materials more readily, add an exciting dynamism or to alter mood dramatically.   
**Post effects/filters** | Can be used in a huge variety of ways. They too may add contrast and enhance detail. Typically they'll be used in many varied/creative ways that are often based more on principles of graphic design or illustration/painting than on physical properties of lenses/film. They'll do so to create mood, control/encourage the eye towards important characters/features (exaggerated depth of field), enhance a sense of action/motion, to evoke a style of poster/cartoon/school of painting, the possibilities are endless.
