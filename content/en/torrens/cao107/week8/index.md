## Assessment 2

Progress census on Discord.. continued.

Implementing the interface has been fairly time consuming and people have worked well despite not having a layout until now.
* Pass/credit for multi load and solid playback of images and sound  
* Distinction/high distinction for more features, threads.

## What would the app look like?

I show a version of a working program. Then talk a bit about threads, and reality of whatâ€™s expected.

## Collections

Helping with the idea of collections.

## Playback

Starting and stopping sounds, hiding and resizing and showing images. Controls in ImGui.

## Threads
